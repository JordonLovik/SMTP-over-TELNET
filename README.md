# SMTP-over-TELNET
Consistently and quickly send emails using TELNET

If you are anything like me you are a heavy user of the backspace key. Which in most every case is no big deal. However if you are turning up a new SMTP relay onsite at a client or you are misusing one you found on an engagement you most definitely donâ€™t have time for typos. Because as you know connecting to a relay over Telnet requires lazer precision and accuracy with every keystroke. One mistype and you are starting over from the beginning. This script is my answer to this problem. Now quickly I can test a relay without wasted time re typing the same thing over and over again. Simply copy the below script and save it as a .vbs script making sure to replace the relevant fields.
